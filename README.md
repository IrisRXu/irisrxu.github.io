# Projects

## PillowSense: Smart Fabric for Sleep Monitoring
*Research Project at MobileX Lab, Columbia University*

Developed a cutting-edge computational fabric system for non-invasive sleep monitoring. This innovative solution combines conductive fabric and pressure-sensitive materials to capture vital signs during sleep, achieving an impressive 92% accuracy in posture classification.

## Emotions through Art
*DevFest Hackathon Project*

Created an AI-powered website that connects users' mental states with artwork from the MET museum database. This 24-hour hackathon project showcases the intersection of technology and art, demonstrating how AI can enhance our appreciation of cultural heritage.

## Plant Recovery Data Analysis
*Data Science Project*

Conducted an in-depth analysis of plant recovery data using R. This project involved applying linear regression techniques and creating effective data visualizations to understand and communicate findings about plant resilience after disturbance.

## Liquid Classification and Area Prediction
*Machine Learning Project*

Developed sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow to classify liquids and predict areas based on sensor inputs. This project achieved over 98% validation accuracy, showcasing the power of deep learning in solving complex classification problems.
